    <div class="narrative-section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this platform is to provide a readily available IDP or SP for your development and integration
            testing.</p>
        <!--        <p class="warning"><strong>Please don't upload production data</strong>.</p>-->
        <div class="emphasis-box">
            <p>SAML Entities are identified by their Entity ID - use unique IDs to prevent overwrites.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The SAML BOX platform consists of two core components working together:</p>

        <p>For <span class="technical-term">Service Provider (SP)</span>, we use <a
                href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/saml2/index.html" target="_blank">Spring
            Security SAML 6.4.3</a>. This handles the complete SAML flow when acting as SP, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Generating and customizing authentication requests</li>
            <li>Validating IDP responses and extracting claims</li>
            <li>Managing user sessions and Single Logout (SLO)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For <span class="technical-term">Identity Provider (IDP)</span>, we leverage <a
                href="https://www.keycloak.org/" target="_blank">Keycloak 26.1.2</a>, as Spring doesn't natively support
            IDP functionality. Keycloak provides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Centralized identity management across protocols (SAML/OAuth/OIDC)</li>
            <li>SP client configuration through its administration API</li>
            <li>Flexible authentication flows and user federation</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Platform Architecture -->
    <div class="narrative-section">
        <h2>Platform Architecture</h2>
        <img th:src="@{/image/samlbox.png}" alt="System Architecture" class="img-fluid rounded">
    </div>

    <!-- Metadata Exchange -->
    <div class="narrative-section">
        <h2>Metadata Management</h2>
        <p>SAML integration requires mutual metadata exchange between SP and IDP:</p>

        <p>Both SAML SP and IDP metadata can be downloaded here: <a href="/saml2/metadata/samlbox">SAML BOX SP
            Metadata</a> and <a href="http://localhost:8080/realms/master/protocol/saml/descriptor">SAML BOX IDP
            Metadata</a>. Your corresponding partner metadata must be uploaded
            to establish trust relationships. Metadata is identified by Entity ID - ensure uniqueness when creating
            new entities.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- SP Functionality -->
    <div class="narrative-section">
        <h2>SAML BOX as Service Provider</h2>
        <div class="emphasis-box">
            <p>There are two types of workflows in SAML: SP-Initiated SSO and IDP-Initiated SSO. (If you are interested
                in
                learning more details, you can check out the tutorial blogs <a
                        href="https://www.bostonidentity.com/post/saml-2-0-explained-in-simple-words-part-i"
                        target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
        </div>

        <p>In SP-Init SSO, a SAML AuthnRequest is sent to IDP and IDP will generate a response after validating a user
            and send back to SP. For that SAML AuthnRequest, there are various things we can configure to tweak the
            AuthnRequest so that IDP can respond differently based on the ask. Here are some of them that you can play
            with in SAML BOX.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>SAML Request Bindings</h3>
        <p>In SAML, bindings are methods used to transport SAML messages between IDP and SP. There are different
            bindings
            defined in the SAML specification:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTTP POST Binding</li>
            <li>HTTP Redirect Binding</li>
            <li>HTTP Artifact Binding</li>
            <li>SOAP Binding</li>
        </ul>
        <p>HTTP POST is the most used while HTTP Redirect is still seen. </p>
        <div class="warning"> Artifact and SOAP bindings are legacy ones and
            are not used anymore in general.
        </div>
        <p>
            SAML BOX supports switching between HTTP POST and HTTP Redirect. Note that this is regarding the <span
                class="technical-term">SAML
            Authentication Request</span> Binding, which is the request that sent from SP to IDP, not SAML Response
            which is
            sent from IDP to SP.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>SAML Response Bindings</h3>
        <p>SAML Response binding can be different from Request binding. In theory, it can be either HTTP POST or HTTP Redirect. However, SAML BOX supports only HTTP POST here.</p>
        <p class="emphasis-box">Regarding SAML Response from IDP, only HTTP POST bindings is supported by SAML BOX.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>NameID-Format</h3>
        <p>NameID-Format depicts how the subject value (the value that identifies the user authenticated to IDP)
            returned in the SAML response should be interpreted by SP. For example, if it's shown as 'emailAddress', the
            subject value should be interpreted as an email value.

            Here are some NameID-Format values:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified</li>
            <li>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress</li>
            <li>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent</li>
            <li>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient</li>
            <li>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:kerberos</li>
            <li>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:X509SubjectName</li>
        </ul>
        <p>SAML BOX supports selecting one of them or custom format value.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>SAML Request Signature</h3>
        <p>The signature information is not required in the SAML Request, but is good to have. In this case, IDP can
            verify the signature using the Public Cert provided (e.g. in SP Metadata) to make sure the request is not
            tampered.</p>
        <p>You can specify whether SAML BOX should add a signature when sending the SAML request.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>SP-Initialized Single Logout (SLO)</h3>
        <p>Single Logout allows a user to log out from all sessions across multiple applications (SPs) plus IDP itself
            in a single action. In this case, a user doesn't need to manually logout each app.</p>

        <p>SAML Box supports <span class="technical-term">SP-init Single Logout</span>, where a SAML Single Logout
            request is sent to IDP.
        <p>
        <p>Here for SAML BOX, when a Single Logout response is sent back, SAML BOX will validate and process it. </p>
        <p class="emphasis-box">Note that it's IDP's responsibility to process that request and send logout response to
            other SPs. Also, signature is required in the SLO response for SAML BOX to process it.</p>
        <p>Once the logout is done, the SAML BOX session will be killed, which can be seen from the session info section
            in SAML BOX UI.</p>

        <p class="warning">IDP-init Single Logout (unsolicited single logout, similar to IDP-init single sign-on) may
            not be supported here due to the limitation of Keycloak.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>SAML Response Encryption</h3>
        <p>While SAML response signature is required, SAML response encryption is optional. The former protects data
            integrity of the response and the latter protects the data confidentiality of the response. When security
            level is high, SAML encryption might be needed, and signature is usually required too. Note that IDP
            usually signs response first and then encrypt.</p>

        <p>When SAML BOX acts as SP, it supports SAML response encryption. </p>
        <p class="emphasis-box"> A signature is required when encryption is enabled.</p>
        <p>IDP uses SP's public cert to encrypt the response and SP will decrypt it using its private key.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- IDP Functionality -->
    <div class="narrative-section">
        <h2>SAML BOX as Identity Provider</h2>
        <div class="emphasis-box">
            <p>As Spring Security SAML is NOT supporting IDP yet, Keycloak is used here as IDP provider.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Keycloak is an Open Source Identity and Access Management platform. It adds authentication to applications
            and secure services with minimum effort, and it provides user federation, strong authentication, user
            management, fine-grained authorization, etc.</p>

        <p>SAML BOX leverages Keycloak APIs to fulfill the IDP role. When a SAML SP client is registered (Keycloak calls
            SP as client, same as in OAuth/OIDC), a list of settings is available for this specific SP. Note that since
            Keycloak is a centralized IAM platform, it can register multiple SPs and each SP will have its own specific
            settings for the login flow.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>IDP-Initiated SSO</h3>
        <p>Normally an IDP generates a SAML response based on the incoming SAML request. Occasionally, IDP can generate
            an unsolicited SAML response and directly send to SP, and this is called IDP-Initiated SSO. This flow is
            useful when SP can't generate SAML request but can accept SAML response.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <p>Note that When using IDP-Initiated SSO, a URL endpoint needs to be specified in the registered SP in
                Keycloak, which is supported by SAML BOX as well.</p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <h3>SAML Bindings (ACS)</h3>
        <p>Similar to SAML Request Bindings, the different binding types can be used in the SAML response too. SAML BOX
            (Keycloak) supports both HTTP POST and HTTP Redirect, which can be specified in the SAML BOX settings.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>NameID-Format</h3>
        Some NameID-formats are supported by Keycloak:
        <ul>
            <li>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified</li>
            <li>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress</li>
            <li>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="emphasis-box">
            <p>When a name NameID-format is selected, that seleced one will be the format returned in the SAML
                response.</p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <h3>SAML Response Signature</h3>
        <p>The signature for SAML Response is mandatory and can be at either Assertion level or the entire Message level
            or both (check
            <a href="https://www.bostonidentity.com/post/saml-2-0-explained-in-simple-words-part-ii" target="_blank">here</a>
            for more info).</p>
        <br>

        <h3>SAML Response Encryption</h3>
        <p>SAML BOX supports encryption when acting as an IDP. Note that an <span class="technical-term">encryption public cert</span>
            is required when
            uploading SP metadata.</p>
